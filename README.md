# Stealth Payroll: A Confidential Payroll and Investment Tool

Stealth Payroll harnesses the power of **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology** to deliver a cutting-edge payroll solution designed for DAO and Web3 companies. This unique tool not only ensures encrypted payment processes but also allows employees to seamlessly and privately invest a portion of their salary into pre-defined DeFi strategies.

## The Challenge at Hand

In the rapidly evolving landscape of decentralized finance, maintaining financial privacy while managing payroll can be a significant challenge. Traditional payroll systems expose sensitive employee data and complicate investment opportunities, leaving individuals vulnerable to financial surveillance and data breaches. Companies require a reliable solution that can address these privacy concerns while facilitating automated investment strategies.

## The FHE Solution: Empowering Financial Privacy

Stealth Payroll addresses these challenges through the implementation of **Zama's open-source libraries**, such as **Concrete** and the **zama-fhe SDK**. By leveraging Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), we ensure that employees' financial data remains confidential during payroll operations, enabling private and secure transactions. This unique capability allows the system to process payroll and investment activities without ever exposing sensitive information, thus protecting the financial privacy of all users.

### Key Features

- üîí **Encrypted Employee Salaries:** All salary payments are processed with FHE encryption, safeguarding employee financial data from unauthorized access.
- üí∏ **Streamlined Payments:** The system supports direct salary payments, enhancing user convenience and ensuring timely transactions.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Customizable Investment Strategies:** Employees can set up automatic investment strategies, such as dollar-cost averaging in ETH, all while maintaining privacy.
- üíª **Confidential Investment Operations:** Every investment action occurs under encryption, ensuring that employees' financial activities remain private and secure.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama SDK**: The cornerstone of our confidential computing, empowering secure transactions and data privacy.
- **Node.js**: For building and managing our server-side applications.
- **Hardhat**: A development environment for Ethereum software, facilitating testing and deployment.

### Example Code Snippet

Here‚Äôs how you can utilize the primary functionality of Stealth Payroll in your application:

```javascript
const { encryptSalary, investSalary } = require('./salaryOperations');

async function processPayroll(employeeId, salary, investmentStrategy) {
    const encryptedSalary = encryptSalary(salary);
    await payEmployee(employeeId, encryptedSalary);
    if (investmentStrategy) {
        await investSalary(employeeId, encryptedSalary, investmentStrategy);
    }
    console.log('Payroll processed successfully with confidential investment.');
}
```

In this example, the `processPayroll` function securely encrypts the salary and facilitates both payment and investment operations, ensuring employee privacy at each step.
